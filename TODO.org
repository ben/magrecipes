* Must-have:
  - [ ] A way to consolidate similar ingredients
  - [ ] Mobile view
        - No fonts, shadows
        - No CUD
  - [ ] Search by multiple criteria?
  - [ ] Text pre-processing
        - [ ] [[http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/bylanguage/mathchart.html#fractions][Vulgar fractions]]
        - [ ] "425F" => "425° F"
        - [ ] Common accented words, such as "sautee" => "sauté"
        - Regex-based list?
        - Which fields? Ingredients too? Anything markdownable? Everything?
  - [ ] Recipes as ingredients
        - Flagged ingredient, link as note?
        - Shouldn't show up in the "Ingredients" index.
        - See "ingredient grouping headers", set name to a link
        - Would need to filter out links from autocomplete/search as well
  - [ ] Ingredient grouping headers
        - Approach one:
          - Markdown ingredient fields
          - Change display to hide hyphens if quantity is empty
          - Filter out ingredients with empty qty/notes for autocomplete/search
        - Approach two:
          - IngredientBase as PolyModel, with Ingredient and IngredientHeader inheriting
          - Would need migration
          - Autocomplete and searach look only at Ingredient's
  - [ ] Calculator
        - Multiply numbers in ingredients' "quantity" fields
        - Multiply numbers in yield
  - [ ] Menus
        - Collection of recipes
        - Title, Blurb
        - Index from landing page
        - Show links in recipe view if a recipe is part of a menu
